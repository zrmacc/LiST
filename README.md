# Setting
Suppose that a continuous outcome $y_{i}\in\mathbb{R}$ and a covariate $x_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{p}$ is observed for each of $n$ subjects. Consider the model:

$$
y_{i} \sim N(X\beta,\tau K)
$$

Here $K$ is a known or previously estimated covariance structure, and $\tau$ is an optional variance component. Partition $\beta = (\beta_{1},\beta_{2})$ and suppose $H_{0}:\beta_{1}=\beta_{10}$ is of interest. 

# Example Data
The list `NST::D` contains simulated data for $n=1000$ subjects. The outcome was generated by adding standard normal residuals to the subject specific means. The mean vector depends on a model matrix `Z` containing an intercept and three independent, standard normal covariates. `Beta` contains the regression parameters used to generate the outcome mean.

## Formatting Assumptions
The model matrix `Z` should be numeric, with all factors and interactions expanded. 

# Score Test
Score tests on $\beta$ are specified using a logical vector `L`. The length of `L` should match the number of columns in the model matrix `Z`. An element of `L` is set to `TRUE` if the regression coefficient for the corresponding column of `Z` is fixed under $H_{0}$. At least one element of `L` must be `TRUE` (i.e. a test must be specified) and at least on element of `L` must be `FALSE` (i.e. a null model must be estimable). The values of regression coefficients fixed under $H_{0}$ are specified using `b0`. By default, `b0` is the zero vector. 

Below, various hypothses are tested on the example data. The first is an overall test of $H_{0}:\beta_{1}=\beta_{2}=\beta_{3}=0$, which is false. The second assesses $H_{0}:\beta_{1}=\beta_{2}=0$, which is again false, treating $\beta_{3}$ as a nuisance. The third considers $H_{0}:\beta_{1}=0.1$, which is in fact true, treating $\beta_{2}$ and $\beta_{3}$ as nuisances. The final considers $H_{0}:\beta_{3}=0$, which is again true, treating $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ as nuisances. All models include an intercept $\beta_{0}$.
